# 4.3.2 â€“ the paper mentions the correlation between the number 
# of household members and the number of unique smart home devices. 
# Is there any correlation between the number of household members 
# and the adoption of specific types of devices? I ask this question because, 
# in 4.3.3, the paper presents the statistical test on the device level 
# (although only the most owned devices), so I wonder whether a similar 
# type of test has been conducted for 4.3.2. As a result, the current 
# analysis feels incomplete.
